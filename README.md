# Microsoft Teams Meeting Attender
 Automatically attends all meetings added to your MS Teams calendar.

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you've added all the correct meetings in your Calendar (keep checking regularly in case meeting links have been replaced).
2. Make sure your system time is accurate. The timings of the meetings in your MS Teams calendar should match your system time. 
3. Make sure the time configuration is in AM/PM format in Microsoft Teams (and not the 24h format).
